## üîç Reconnaissance

### üìå Passive Reconnaissance

- No direct interaction with the target
- Tools & Techniques:
  - Google Dorking
  - WHOIS
  - Netcraft
  - Shodan


whois target.com

Active Reconnaissance
Direct interaction to discover open ports and services


nmap -sC -sV -oN scan.txt [Target-IP]
Nmap helps identify services and potential vulnerabilities



 Enumeration
Deeper look into services discovered during scanning

Examples:

SMB enumeration

FTP anonymous login

HTTP directory brute-force

enum4linux -a [Target-IP]

 Exploitation Basics
 
Introduced to Metasploit for exploiting known vulnerabilities

Hands-on practice in launching basic attacks safely in lab
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/...

Conclusion
‚úÖ Room Completed
‚úÖ Understood full pentesting cycle
‚úÖ Gained experience with core tools and methodology
